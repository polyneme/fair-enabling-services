An attempt to design and deploy prototypical [FAIR-Enabling Services](https://donnywinston.com/posts/implementing-the-fair-principles-through-fair-enabling-artifacts-and-services/).

## Intro

Related to [FAIR-Enabling Resource](https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/FAIR-Enabling-Resource) ***artifacts***, from the [FAIR Implementation Profile (FIP) ontology](https://w3id.org/fair/fip/terms/FIP-Ontology), are ***services***. These services are what you deploy to implement each of the 15 [FAIR Principles](https://w3id.org/fair/principles/terms/FAIR) (from Box 2 of the [seminal publication](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18)) for any actual given digital research object.

### Code architecture

Attempting a domain-driven design and event-driven microservices approach, with corresponding code organization, as detailed by Percival and Gregory in [^patterns].
